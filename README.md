# Facebook-LoginPage
This project is a front-end clone of the Facebook login and sign-up page, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It replicates the core visual elements of Facebook's authentication page, including a blue-themed UI, centered login box, and tab switching between login and registration forms.
